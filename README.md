# Agda-sessions
Learn the Agda basics in three 2-hour sessions.

This Agda tutorial was constructed by Jesper Cockx and are presently maintained by Andreas Nuyts as part of a CS master course titled "Formal Systems and their Applications" at KU Leuven, Belgium. We decided to make these public after receiving comments that there aren't so many quick Agda tutorials out there.
